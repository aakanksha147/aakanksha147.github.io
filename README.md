1. Optimization of Loading Time : I have minified all the css and js files to optimize the loading time of the application. Moreover CDN files could be used but i did not use them so as to make this app offline usable.

2. Mobile responsive app : I have used bootstrap framework to ensure the grid system and layout is followed for all screen sizes.

3. Progressive Web App : As i have used the most complex chart and graph library, bootstrap framework and the trending JS framework (AngularJS) for single page applications, this web-app can be considered as a progressive web app.

4. Offline Usable : There is no dependency on the internet for any sort of library or image or link so the web-app is offline usable.
